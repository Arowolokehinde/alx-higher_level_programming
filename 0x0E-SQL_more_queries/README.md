Readme: MySQL Database Basics

This Readme provides an overview of essential MySQL database concepts and operations to help users effectively manage their databases. Below are explanations and instructions on various topics related to MySQL databases:

How to create a new MySQL user:
To create a new MySQL user, you can use the CREATE USER statement followed by the username and identified by the password. For example:

sql
Copy code
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
How to manage privileges for a user to a database or table:
To manage privileges for a user in MySQL, you can use the GRANT statement. For example, to grant all privileges to a user on a specific database:

sql
Copy code
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
What’s a PRIMARY KEY:
A PRIMARY KEY is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It ensures that no two rows in a table have the same values in the designated column(s).

What’s a FOREIGN KEY:
A FOREIGN KEY is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link or relationship between data in two tables. It typically refers to the PRIMARY KEY of another table, enforcing referential integrity.

How to use NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints:
In MySQL, the NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values, while the UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique.

How to retrieve data from multiple tables in one request:
To retrieve data from multiple tables in one request, you can use JOIN clauses to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

What are subqueries:
Subqueries are nested SQL queries within another query. They can be used to retrieve data based on the results of another query, acting as a condition or filter.

What are JOIN and UNION:

JOIN: JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Types of JOINs include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.
UNION: UNION is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows by default unless specified with UNION ALL.
